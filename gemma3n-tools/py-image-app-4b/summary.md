# Project Summary

1. **Create a Python script for random number generation**: The main goal is to develop a Python script that can generate random numbers.

2. **Define the range for the random numbers**: The script should include functionality to specify the range within which the random numbers will be generated.

3. **Implement the random number generation logic**: The core of the project involves writing the logic to generate random numbers within the defined range.

4. **Add a function to generate random numbers**: A reusable function will be created to handle the random number generation, making the code modular and easy to use.

5. **Add a main block to test the function**: A main block will be included to test the functionality of the random number generator, ensuring it works as expected.

This project is focused on creating a simple yet functional random number generator in Python, with clear steps to follow for implementation and testing.
